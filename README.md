# WhatsAppClone2

This is a personal project which replicates some of the WhatsApp features in an Android environment. 
It is possible to create an account and log in. But the main features are the possibility to add contacts and communicate with each other. 
The UI make use of the Material Design standards.
The back-end was developed using Firebase to perform the OA2 authentication and message storing, through the use of a noSQL database.
